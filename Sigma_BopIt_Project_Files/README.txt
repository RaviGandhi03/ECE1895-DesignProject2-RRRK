This archive is organized with software, hardware, enclosure, and testing files. This readme file contains a brief description of what can be found in each file:

SOFTWARE DESIGN FILES: 

HARDWARE DESGIN FILES: the design files for both the two layer board and the four layer board are included. We ultimately used the two layer board as it supported the LCD display (while the four layer board was required for the hex displays) as it was similar to work out the hardware design and it was more stable in terms of performance. 
Files Included: 

ENCLOSURE DESIGN FILES: we decided to 3D print our enclosure since there were many custom sized interfaces (the inputs that the user interacts with and the different LEDs and LCD display). We used wires to solder these elements on and made custom slots to glue or tape the components onto the enclosure.
